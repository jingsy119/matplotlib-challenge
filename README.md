## Description
### A new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medication desires to screen for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma, a frequently occuring skin cancer. The purpose of this challenge is to utilize the given mice treatment data of several drug regimens over the course of 45 days and examine their tumor development. The drug of interest, Capomulin, is compared against other drug regimens. 
## Analysis
- Data was prepared by merging the mouse_metadata and study_results into one single DataFrame for analysis
- DataFrame was cleaned and a summary statistics was generated
- Bar charts and pie charts were produced showing the total number of time ponts for all tested mice, and the distribution of mice's sex, respectively
- Statitsical analysis were performed, e.g., quartiles, outliers, and a box plot was generated illustrating the distribution of final tumor volume for all the mice in each drug treatment regimen
- Line plot and scatter plot were created to displlay tumor volume versus time point as well as tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment
- Correlation coefficient and regression were calculated to evaluate the statistical significance of the line plot
